### Introduction

In an effort to learn python, I decided to make something really random and pointless.

### Installation

Install Pygame:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pygame --user
```

### Setup

Pygame requires [Python3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-programming-environment-on-an-ubuntu-16-04-server) to run, please install if you don't already have it.

then simply...


```bash
python3 game.py
```

Enjoy?
